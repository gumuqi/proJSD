<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The rational
choice of 4. flushing and laser cutting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>When sheet metal
processing enterprises have just received new investment projects, they will be
faced with such a choice. Should they buy a laser cutting equipment or a CNC
punch press? As we all know, in today's metal sheet processing industry, there
seem to be ten thousand reasons to push the sheet metal processing enterprises
to invest in laser cutting machines. In addition, with the vigorous development
of the generation processing business, many enterprises may start to consider
the gradual recovery of the outsourcing processing business, and plan to enter
the new business field at the same time. If the business just received a large
number of large orders, then if you have such a hesitant as a decision maker,
what are the most important parameters for investment evaluation? In addition,
before the formal signing of the contract, how should you decide that you have
made the right decision in this respect?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Take the cost and
the production process as the yardstick</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the past two
years, there is an idea in the market that is constantly being spread, and its
influence is also expanding. &quot;The era of digital stamping has passed.
Laser cutting is the future and gospel of metal sheet processing
industry.&quot; However, in the view of a senior sheet metal engineer, this
sentence is obviously too extreme and impetuous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>At any time, a
qualified sheet metal processing manufacturer needs to make proper combination
and distribution of different processing equipment, so as to make the most lean
material flow in the workshop, so as to produce the most stable sheet metal
parts at the lowest possible cost. Einstein once had a famous saying: &quot;in
this world, the machine that can accomplish the production task in the simplest
way is the most perfect machine.&quot; Here we can also borrow this sentence,
&quot;in this world, the most concise and low-cost way to accomplish the production
tasks most quickly and stably is the most perfect process&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Therefore, when an
experienced metal processing enterprise managers in the production planning and
investment, he will be the cost of electricity, the cost of consumables and
maintenance costs to cost listed in the hour, supplemented by the production
flexibility and stability considerations, he will in the popular ideas and
practical the results of the assessment, make their rational judgment and
decision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mr. Peter Visser,
a senior application consulting expert of MATE precision mould Co., Ltd., has
over 25 years of industry experience and has visited over 1000 sheet metal
processing enterprises. The biggest cost control item he participated in his
career is to help a world-famous manufacturer to choose the appropriate digital
punch and laser equipment for different process and processing requirements,
thus saving massive processing cost for the enterprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the Mr. Peter
Visser occupation career, see too many customers directly to 1 &quot;this consignment
to laser processing&quot;, but never aware of the different process will
produce different effects on the entire manufacturing process, also did not
consider the subsequent processing bottleneck caused by improper process.
Sometimes, the customer will use the thick plate to process the number of
blanking, but the thin plate is processed by laser. In fact, it is a better
choice to change the two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>For example, in
the field of architectural design and HVAC, we will use massive group holes to
implement design or ventilation. However, a lot of customers want to use laser
cutting machine to process, which leads to very slow processing speed and high
production cost. In order to let the readers have a better understanding of the
differences, we give an example: in a 1.5mm thick steel plate processing 1000 12.7mm diameter hole, if the number of punching die holes with a 12 hole processing, so it needs not to use the 1/4 for laser processing. This means
that if customers receive a large order, they will have to invest 4~5 laser
cutting machines to meet the capacity of 1 units.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Another key point
which is extremely important but often overlooked is that the use of digital
punching device can effectively avoid the limitation of laser processing in the
whole production process.</span></p>
