In general, it is based on this datum as the standard of programming. The

part. In order to ensure the machining accuracy and reduce the amount of
calculation in the program design, the programming datum should be chosen as

of NC punching programming is to expand the parts.&nbsp; Generally, the general
CNC punching machine program is based on the drawing, using the source code, by
hand by step by step. This way is basically not a problem for simpler graphics,
but for complex graphics, this way is not only time-consuming, but also very
easy to make mistakes. For complex parts and high precision parts, the use of
commonly used drawing software, such as CAD, SOLIDWORKS, UG etc. the parts and
generate the 1:1 DXF file, and then through the CNC punching machine
programming software built-in call graph function, as shown in Figure 2,
directly transferred to DXF graphics, then shop mode etc. to complete the part
programming. The program developed by this method is not only relatively low in
error rate, but also with much less time and manpower.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:������;color:#3E3E3E'>One of the
most important prerequisites for programming is to choose the right mold and
always choose the same size as the hole. When there is no die with the same size
as the aperture, the choice is made according to the actual situation. For
example, we need to manufacture a square hole with 38mm * 38mm, while the mold library has only 20mm * 20MM, 30mm x 30mm and 40mm * 40MM square mold. The mold we should choose is 20mm mode. Although it is possible to use the square mode of 30mm * 30MM, but as shown in Figure 3, (a) is the form of square die stamping with 20mm * 20MM, (b) is the form of square die stamping with 30mm * 30MM. Obviously, every part of the size of the left flush is consistent with the size of the die, die loss basically unchanged; and the right of every part is washed away
a little, so die loss is increasing. Obviously, 4 times also need to be washed,
and the square mode of 20mm x 20mm is much more reasonable than the square mode of 30mm x 30mm.</span></p>

Figure 4, there is a long waist shaped hole of 14mm * 7mm, do not use to erode the way, but both ends of the circular mold with 7, the middle section adopts the square die 7mm * 7mm, long waist shape hole out not only within this relatively smooth, but also eroded than die loss the way much less. When the mold is laid, it is possible to reduce
the length of the hole by using the way of encroaching, which not only helps to
reduce the loss of the mold, but also helps to reduce the burr.</span></p>

relatively simple, easy, but also very time saving when programming the mold.</span></p>

program design of NC punching machine, we should choose reasonable order of
changing mould, and the general principles are: first, circle hole, rear hole, first
hole, then big hole, first, middle and then shape.&nbsp; At the same time,
after the selection of a set of moulds, for the sake of shortening the
processing time, all the types of holes that need to be processed on this part
should be completed. In order to reasonably select the die changing order, we
should also select the best tool path for the mould, so as to reduce the empty
stroke and improve the production efficiency, and ensure the safe and reliable
operation of the machine.</span></p>

both of which are processed from the first hole in the lower left corner of the
map (a) knife route is circuitous along the Y direction and processing, so that
not only the processing time is relatively long, but also in the mesh CNC
